<p align="justify">Sokoban is a puzzle game, in which player pushes boxes in a warehouse by worker. Goal of game is put all boxes in right places. In the game we have 6 kind of squares (floor, floor with mark, wall, player, box and marked box). The player can walks horizontal or vertical in a warehouse, but he canâ€™t walk through walls or boxes. The player move worker by sliding finger on a screen. Worker goes in the same direction as the finger move. <br /></p>
If on the way of worker is box/marked box than he push it by 1 square. <br />
If behind the box is wall than move is not realized. <br />
If behind the box is marked square box is turns into marked box. <br />
If marked box is push in no marked floor than it turns into box. <br />
If on the way of worker is wall than move is no realized. <br />
